# The effect of greenspace on air quality: an analysis of Jefferson County, Kentucky

## Map Description

This map is created to produce a visual representation to support studies that indicate the presence of greenspaces have a postive influence on air quality of environments.
These studies, such as [Maas 2006](https://jech.bmj.com/content/60/7/587) state that greenspaces such as parks and dense tree canopy can benefit human health and the surrounding environment. The air quality of an environment is measured using the Air Quality Index (AQI) and determines how safe the air is for human health and is quantified on the scale below .
